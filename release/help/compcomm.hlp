 Compressed File Manipulation
 ----------------------------
   ^variantname has four capabilities related to compressed files.  The
first is explained more fully in the UPLOAD help file, so we'll just mention
it here: ^nodetitle may be configured to optionally test compressed files
after uploads (by invoking external programs).

   Second, you may peek into the Table of Contents of any compressed file
(that is, any file with an extention of ARC, ZIP, ZOO, or LZH).  The
command for this is

    <.R>ead <A>rchive <D>irectory

   You will be prompted for the name or names of files to peek into, and
you may use file-specs and date-specs when you answer this (as explained
in the DOWNLOAD help file).

   Third, you may be able to ask ^variantname to compress messages before
sending them to you using the <C>ompress option on .Read.  For instance,

     .Read Xmodem Compressed New <CR>

would result in the new messages in the current room being sent to you using
the compression method you specify (you're prompted after the carriage return),
using Xmodem for the transfer.  Naturally, other protocols may be specified.
A single file will reside in the resulting compressed file.

     .Read Global Xmodem Compressed New <CR>

would send a compressed file of all the new messages on the system to you.

   Fourth, you may be able, depending on how the sysop has configured the
system, to extract one or more files from the compressed files for download.
Normally, when faced with a compressed file you'd simply want to grab the
whole thing.  However, sometimes it's desirable to extract a file or two
from a compressed file.  Perhaps a READ.ME file is enticing, perhaps you
just need to get an updated file.  In any case, being able to extract one
or more files from a compressed file can be useful.  The command for this is

    <.R>ead <A>rchive <F>ile

   You will be asked which compressed file you will be decompressing from.
You may only specify one file here, but you needn't mention the extension;
if ^variantname can't find what you type, it'll append a .ARC, .ZIP, .ZOO,
and .LZH (in that order) until it finds the file or runs out of extensions.
If ^variantname finds the file and ^nodetitle is configured to support
decompressing files of that type, it will then ask you for
a "deARC mask".  All this means is that you may now tell the decompress
utility which files to decompress.  You can answer with a list of files
(separate each file name from the next with a space) or use normal "wildcard"
characters or a mixture of both.

   ^variantname will now try to extract the files you asked for from the
compressed file.  Be patient, especially if the computer the BBS is on is
slow.  When the decompressor is finished, and if it found any files to
send to you, ^variantname will start sending the files.

   But using what transfer protocol?  Using the basic .RAF command from above,
^variantname would use ASCII for the transfer, which may not be appropriate
if you were trying to get executable files.  Therefore, you may modify the
.RAF command with any of the protocols supported on ^nodetitle (see PROTOCOL,
below).  For instance, to transfer a bunch of files from a compressed file
using YMODEM (BATCH mode), you'd use

    <.R>ead <Y>modem <A>rchive <F>ile
