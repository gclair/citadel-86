  Citadel-86 will format your biography to the readers' screen width.
Carriage-return
characters are treated as blanks unless followed by a blank, so paragraphs
should be indented or separated by blank lines with at least one space
on them.  If you want to delete your current biography, simply save a
blank biography.
