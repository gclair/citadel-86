 Advanced Reading Options
 ------------------------
    ^variantname's Advanced Reading commands contain a number of useful
options which can greatly enhance your pleasure if you take just a couple
of minutes to find out what they can do.  Study the following carefully...

 Basics
   You should already be familiar with the basic single stroke Message
Reading commands and the general idea of "dot" commands.  The generic
format of the .Read commands for viewing Messages is

   <.R>ead [Option ...] [Read Command [Message Limit Command] ] <CR>

   Or, in English, ".Read" followed by zero or more "Options" followed by
a single, optional "Read Command" (default is <N>ew messages) and optional
"date-spec".  We'll explain these one at a time, starting with the "Read
Commands" (since you should find them familiar anyways), then the "date-spec",
and finally the "Options".  Don't worry, this WILL make sense ...
  
 Read Commands
   Here are the four basic Read Commands for messages; each should be
ended with a C/R:
  
  <.R>ead <F>orward
    will print all messages in room from beginning.

  <.R>ead <N>ew messages
    will print all new messages in room.

  <.R>ead <O>ld-reverse
    will print all old msgs in reverse order in room.

  <.R>ead <R>everse
    will print all messages in reverse chronological order.

   These four should be familiar from the single stroke command set, and
they are exactly the same.  However, as you'll see, they are NOT superfluous.

 MESSAGE LIMIT COMMAND

    The optional Message Limit Command of .Read allows you to deal a little
more sanely with large numbers of messages.  You have three alternatives
to work with:

 1. Date-Spec
   A "date-spec" is simply some date of your choosing, expressed in normal
Citadel format.  For instance, July 4th, 1989 would be 89Jul4 (or 89Jul04).
If the current year was 1989, you could shorten that to Jul4.  In fact, the
month can be shortened even farther if it remains "unique" within the range
of months.  For instance, you can't type "Ju" because ^nodetitle won't know
if you mean July or June.  However, you can type "N4" to mean November 4th,
because there is no other month with the first letter of November.

   But what does this have to do with reading?  When you use it with one of
the Read Commands, you are telling ^variantname to either Read only those
messages since or before that date, depending on the exact Read Command you
are using.  For example,

  .Read New 88Jan4

     will print all the new messages in the room entered SINCE
January 4, 1988, while

  .Read Old-reverse 88Jan4

     will print all the old messages in the room entered BEFORE
January 4, 1988, and in reverse order.

   In general, Read New and Read Forward used with a date-spec will display
messages written since the given date, while Read Reverse and Read Old-reverse
will display messages written before the given date.

 2. Day Count
   You can simply specify a number as a Message Limit Command.
^variantname will then simply use that to mean "in the last x days."  For
example,

    .Read New 5

asks ^nodename to show all the new messages in the current room posted in the
last 5 days.

 3. Message Count
   ^variantname will also accept a Message Limit Command of the form '#<number',
which means "show at most x messages", and the x messages shown will be the
last 'x' messages that would have been shown using the command options without
this particular option.  EXAMPLE:

     .Read New #5

 would show you the last 5 new messages in the current room.  (NOTE: This
option does not work well with any of the Options in the next section.)

 Options
   The Options actually fall into three groups, from which you can mix and
match nearly any combination (don't worry, those which don't make sense will
be blindingly obvious).  The groups are Search Options, Transfer Options,
and the Global Option.

   You have three Search options:
 o <U>ser.  This lets you search for messages from a particular user, and,
if this is a network system, for messages from a particular system.
 o <P>hrase.  This lets you search for messages containing a given phrase.
 o <L>ocal.  This lets you search for messages originating on ^nodetitle.

   Both the User and Phrase options are used in the same way: specify them
while you are typing in the command, and after you hit a carriage return you
will be prompted for each in turn.  Local, on the other hand, doesn't require
any further input, since it only means the system should search for messages
which were written on this system (and thus the command only makes sense in
Shared rooms).

   A couple of examples.  Suppose you wanted to find all the New messages
written by Joe Blow.  You'd type (at the room prompt)

   .Read User New <CR>

   The system would then prompt for a name, to which you'd type "Joe Blow"
(sans quotes), and the system would go searching the New messages for those
written by good old Joe.  Or suppose you wanted to find a message from Joe
when he was writing on a local system named "Mundane" (so the message
header looks like "... Joe Blow @ Mundane ...").  Then, after you typed
.Read User New <CR>, you'd respond to the User prompt with "Joe @ Mundane"
(notice you didn't have to type in the entire name to find "Joe Blow" --
this applies as well to the system name).

   Suppose you wanted to find all the messages,
new or not, containing the Phrase "archaeology".  You'd type

   .Read Phrase Forward <CR>

   The system would then prompt for the phrase, to which you'd type
"archaeology" (case-insensitive search, by the way), and the system would
happily search all the messages in the current room for such messages.

   ^variantname also supports transferring messages via several transfer
protocols besides basic ASCII.  Since this is an Option, that's where the
command would go.

   You may use either of the two built-in transfer protocols
of ^variantname (<X>modem and <Y>modem [but in SINGLE FILE mode only, not
BATCH]).  Additionally, ^nodetitle supports the following
protocols via external drivers which you may use to download messages:
^dlprotocols

   A basic example, downloading all the New messages in a room via Xmodem:

   .Read Xmodem New

   You would then be asked if you were ready, and if you answer Yes, the
system would drop into Xmodem download mode, in which all those New messages
will be transferred as a text file, formatted to your current screen width
setting.  (Answering No aborts the transfer).

   Naturally, you can combine any of the transfer protocols with any of the
other options already discussed.  For instance,

   .Read Ymodem User New

   would result in the system prompting for a User name to search on and
then try to start a Ymodem Single download, resulting in a transfer of all
messages which written by the user you typed in using Ymodem.
 
   The Compressed option (.Read Compressed) allows you to download messages
into a file which is then compressed using a compression program you select.
This option can, and should be, used in conjunction with other options,
particularly the Protocols mentioned above.  When you touch the carriage
return after typing in your command line, you'll be prompted for the compression
style you wish to use from a list, and the resultant file will be sent in that
format.

   Please note that not all installations will support this option since it
requires work on the sysop's part.

   Finally, the Global Option.  You may read the entire board in one swell
foop if you wish.  The Global modifier is used to do this.  The typical use
for this command would be

   .Read Global New <C/R>

 which would give you all the new messages and mark all the rooms as being
read by you -- Forward, Old, and Reverse when used with Global do not.
However, the Global modifier may be used in combination with other modifiers.
For instance, if you want to find all the messages accessible to you that
contain the phrase "Todd has chickenpox", you would type

   .Read Global Phrase Forward <C/R>

 and type that phrase in when prompted.  And if you wanted the messages
compressed

   .Read Compressed Global Phrase Forward <C/R>
   
   Don't forget, all of the above can be combined in a number of useful
combinations.  Don't be afraid to do a little experimentation!

 Miscellaneous
 -------------
   Finally, there are two miscellaneous options.

     .Read Status

   will print the number of messages in system, etc. 

     .Read More ...

   when used to read messages will reverse the value of your Message Paging
configuration option (see the TERM help file).  So, if you have Message Paging
turned off and you use .Read More, the Message Paging will occur.  Similarly,
if you have Message Paging turned off and use .Read More, Message Paging will
be turned on for the duration of the read messages operation.  This is useful
when you don't want to reconfigure for a single operation.
