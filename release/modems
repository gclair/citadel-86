  For effective use of the SmartModem 2400:
 o set STORED PROFILE 0 to the following values using
the AT command
 E0 Q0 V1 X3 Y0 &C1 &D2 &G0 &J0 &L0 &P0 &Q0 &R0 &S0 &X0
S0=1
 o Set the modem to use PROFILE 0 for all power-up and
and reset conditions by using the AT&W0 command.
 o Use a comm program to do the above before attempting
to use your SmartModem with Citadel-86.

 o Your modem cable MUST support CTS.
 o You'll find your LOCK-PORT parameter is set to 4
   (9600 baud).  You can up that if you have a good
   UART chip.

  The \N0 in the dialing strings disables Error Control
  Mode.  Some slower modems may support Error Control
  Mode (basically MNP) so you may wish to use the Access
  String of the specific nodes using those modems when
  dialing them.  But most slower modems don't, so \N0
  is used for those dialing speeds.

  (Experimental) Set DIP Switch 4 ON.  Set DIP Switch 5
  OFF.  Using a COM program, first make SURE you are
  talking to the modem at 19.2K, then do "AT&F1"
  (carriage return), "ATE0 M0 &A0 S0=1" (cr), "AT&W0"
  (cr).  Also see USRSPORT.LZH on Test System in Latest

  AT&Q6 S36=3 S48=128 S95=0 N0 W2 S0=1
