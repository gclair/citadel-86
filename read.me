Below is the original read.me file as provided with the Citadel-86 v3.49 
source code.  

It is unknown how much of this file remains valid today.  Best to assume 
that most if not all of it is still valid.

===========================================================================
This is a release of Citadel-86 Source: 3.49.

Status
~~~~~~
   The original Citadel source by Cynbe ru Taren was released with few, if
any, constraints on it.  Basically, I can't lay down much in the way of
conditions, but here's a few ...

1) Those files with a copyright in them are not subject to anything in this
file.  They are independent source modules I've written for my own use
that found application within Citadel, but are not Citadel in themselves.
I've included those files out of the goodness of my heart, not because
I feel constrained to do so.  Observe those copyrights strictly, since they
aren't Citadel.  And some may be other people's copyrights, anyways, not mine.

2) Don't try to intermix the current network code with old Citadel variants.
Just don't.

3) Don't try to stab me in the back with any of this source.  I didn't like
it last time, I won't like it this time.

4) Don't change* the network code if you're running a system on the net.  I
very much do not want some system mucking about, screwing up the network,
and then coming crying to me to fix their problems.  Adding code is a
different proposition, but changing the code is just asking for trouble unless
you're an experienced programmer and not just another idiot hacker.

Missing Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Due to the fact that certain parts of the source used to build Citadel-86
executables derive from certain contract work, not all the source that
Citadel-86 is built from is available.  None of the missing source is critical.
The source accessing the missing source should usually contain notes or
otherwise be obvious as to how to deal with the missing stuff.  That missing
source is ...

CTDL.EXE
--------
lss.c - independent library for implementing sysop windows.

UTILITIES
---------
goo.lib - this has some screen editing libraries etc that are used by
lgibm.c, nodeedit.c, maybe others.

All Ease Source - it's too interlaced with stuff I can't deliver so it's
not worth putting it out.  In any case, true porters wouldn't have any use
for it.

Variants
~~~~~~~~
   If you decide you're going to give your variant a name (especially if
you're going to distribute it), DON'T call it:

 o Citadel
 o Citadel-86 or anything derivative thereof
 o Citadel-68K or anything derivative thereof (unless Tony Preston says so)
 o Amiga Citadel or anything derivative thereof (unless Tony Preston says so)
 o Macadel or anything derivative thereof

   Those are already used.  If you think you're going to add multi-line
headers or oodles of keen menus, don't even call it Citadel.  Call it
RBBS-II or something equally descriptive.

Contributing to Citadel-86
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Just 'cuz I'm making the source available after 4 years (or whatever)
doesn't mean I'm dropping out.  If you're mucking about with the source and
think you've come up with something "neat" that others might like and you'd
like to see it in Citadel-86, I have no general objection to adding code
from others -- I've done it before.  Guidelines:

 o Don't get offended if I don't use your stuff - life's a crapshoot;

 o Don't get offended if I'm a bit slow - I have a real life;

 o Preferably submit in a .LZH or similar file;

 o Document the feature or change in English in a separate file;

 o Make the code changes very very clear to me.  I agree this can be tough
to do, but don't just send me half the source and tell me to look for all
the places you marked.  I'll just delete what you sent me.  Preferably,
modularize the changes so it can either be compiled and linked as a separate
file, or just added to an existing source module.

 o Don't get offended if I change it; after X years I know what resources
Citadel has and you probably don't.  Congratulations if you spent the time
to find just what Citadel already has, I'll respect you for that, but don't
feel bad if you didn't -- it's a helluva lot of source and some of it is
non-obvious.

 o Perhaps I feel most ambiguous about code optimization (for space).  It's
one of the best ways to learn programming when you're a novice, and I'd
love to get Citadel's waist size down, but it's a bitch to integrate such
code back in .. or at least so I think.  And new programmers often think
optimization means spaghetti code.  Often it's just the reverse ... obvious
code is often small code that works.  Spaghetti is something wannabe hackers
put out.

Don't Bother To ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 o Make shirty remarks concerning the quality of the source.  For those who
think they're God's gift to programming, please keep in mind this source has
been worked on by at least a half dozen people, with various and changing
skill levels.  I myself got the source when I was a raw novice and have long
used it as an experimental programming arena, and have left those experiments
in 'cuz they work, more or less.  Make a snotty comment about code quality and
I'm just going to ignore it.

 o Tell me about how you just put ANSI color handling in and you're so proud.
I'm not interested.

 o Tell me how you put toggleable multi-line headers in.  I'll just direct you
to a local RBBS.

 o You put neat-o menu code in.  Go away.  Learn what design philosophy's
all about.
